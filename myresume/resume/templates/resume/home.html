					<h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>3 years ago, I wrote down my first django project. Django is a python framework that helps you to develop web based applications very well. I had to learn python quickly though with the aid of my colleagues at Moap Uganda Limited. </p>

					<p>Before I knew it, i was added onto the team that was developing clients' software. My newbie self was now helping to develop and host web based applications like the Human Resource management system.</p>

					<p>From this you’ll see that I’m someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>After almost three years of developing simple projects on my own,  I’m ready to learn something new. I'll be collaborating and sharing my experience with others on my blog  & youtube channel.</p>
				<p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
